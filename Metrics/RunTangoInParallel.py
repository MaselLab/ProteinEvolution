'''
The purpose of this script is to read in protein sequences from a MySQL database and to calculate aggregation metrics for them using the executable Tango. 

This script makes use of the multiprocessing module to run Tango on multiple proteins in the database simultaneously. This allows the script to be run on fairly large datatables in a reasonable period of time. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submodules

There are only two submodules that need to be imported from the submodule script (RunTangoInParallel_Submodules.py):

   1) LoadMySQLConnectionInformation -- Stores the data that is needed to access the MySQL database where the protein sequences are stored. There is no input for this function and there are four outputs:
           1) Username to access the MySQL database
           2) Password used to access the MySQL database
           3) IP address used to acces the MySQL database
           4) The name of the database that needs to be accessed

   2) CalculateAggregation_Tango -- This calculates the various aggregation metrics for the user and returns them to the user. The input/output is the following

      Input:
           1) ProteinSequence -- The input amino acid sequence 
           2) batch=0 -- If the process is being run in parallel, this is used to differentiate the various files that are output from Tango
           3) PfamIndices= None -- If the metrics are desired for domains, the start/stop indices of the domain should be included as a list ([start,stop]). Multiple domains are allowed.
           4) Domains = False -- This lets the program know whether only the full protein is being considered (False), or if domains are being considered (True). The default is False. If it is set to True, PfamIndices is required
           5) AggThreshold=5 -- This is the threshold for a raw Tango score to be considered aggregation prone
           6) RunThreshold=5 -- This is the number of scores above the AggThreshold needed in a row to be considered an APR
           7) ct='N' -- Required by Tango, c-terminal
           8) nt='N', Required by Tango, n-terminal
           9) ph='7.0' -- Required by Tango, temperature (K)
           10) te='298.15' -- Required by Tango, temperature (K)
           11) io='0.02' -- Reqired by Tango, ionic strength

     Output:
           1) AggregationList -- This is output as a list of the raw scores output by Tango. NULL if Tango was not run on this sequence. Either the sequence was too long (>2000 residues), there were more than three unknown residues in a row (X's) in the sequence, or an unknown residue was found in an APR.
           2) NumOfAggProneRegions_FullProtein -- The total number of APRs showing up in the sequence
           3) NumOfAggProneRegions_Density_FullProtein -- The total number of APRs divided by the length of the sequence
           4) NumOfAAInAPRs_FullProtein -- The number of amino acids inside an APR
           5) NumOfAAInAPRs_Density_FullProtein -- The number of amino acids inside an APR divided by the length of the sequence

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           The output entries below are only returned in the input field Domains is set to True and PfamIndices are supplied. All output is supplied as a list with each entry matching the index in the input Pfam list

           6) numOfAggProneRegions_List_Pfam -- The number of APRs in the domain 
           7) numOfAggProneRegions_Density_List_Pfam -- The number of APRs in the domain divided by the length of the domain
           8) numOfAAsInAPRs_List_Pfam -- The number of residues in APRs in the domain
           9) numOfAAsInAPRs_Density_List_Pfam -- The number of residues in the APRs in the domain divided by the length of the domain

This function is used to check to see whether a sequence passes imposed quality filters before it's run through Tango. Specifically, if a protein has three or more unknown residues in sequence, then the protein does not pass the filter and the user is notified to not use the sequence for Tango analysis. 

There is only one input: The protein sequence being considered for analysis

And there is only one output: True or False depending on whether the sequence passes the quality check or not.
