This script is designed to determine the transmembrane status of Pfam domains based on tmhmm predictions. 

Tmhmm predictions output strings of indices associated with helix boundaries. A domain is counted as transmembrane if either:

   1) At least 50% of the domain is contained with a helix

   or

   2) At least 50% of a helix is contained within a domain

These two conditions are necessary as only accepting condition 1) would reject long domains completely containing a helix. Similarly, only accepting codition 2) would reject short pfams completely contained within a long helix.

As the cutoff of 50% is arbitrary, this script does not assign binary values to the output but instead outputs a floating value which it uploads to the domain metric table allowing some fiddling in downstream analyses if desired.

The output value is the maximum fraction either of the ... and is calculated in the following way

   a) The boundaries of each helix are searched against the domain boundaries
   b) If overlap is found, the fraction of the overlap relative to both the domain and the helix is found and the max value is retained
   c) Once all overlaps are accounted for a particular domain, the maximum value of all retained fractions is selected and uploaded to the domain metrics table under TmhmmTopology

# This makes it so that downstream analysis is selecting a cutoff based on the best helix overlaps for each domain
