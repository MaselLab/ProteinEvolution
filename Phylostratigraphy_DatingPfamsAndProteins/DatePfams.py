The purpose of this script is to assign dates to Pfams in our dataset.

First, in order to aquire the various dates associated with the divergence of all species in our dataset, we uploaded the list of species in our dataset to TimeTree.org. The Newick file was then downloaded.

Next, a database was made with each unique Pfam assigned to its own row. The databases containing all the genomes for this work were then searched for occurences of each Pfam. The list of all species in which the Pfam appeared was saved in the Pfam datatable.

Each Pfam 


General Age-Assigning Algorithm:
--------------------------------

The reason a different algorithm is used when only one species is present (algorithm [2]) is because the function [species_list].get_common_ancestor is used to find the subtree in the overall tree that has the common ancestor of all the species in the species list as the root node. If only one species is present, then the entire tree is returned as the subtree, invalidating the methodology used for algorithm [1] (half the length of the entire tree will always be assigned as the age of the Pfam in this case, so all Pfams with only one species associated with them will get the same, inaccurate age). 

-----

algorithm [1]: Used when more than one species is present:
   - The ete3 function [species_list].get_common_ancestor() is used to pull the subtree which has the common ancestor of all species in the species_list as the root node. 

   - The ete3 function subtree.iter_descendants("preorder") is used to iterate through the tree, starting at the root common node and going down one branch of the subtree. Because the Newick tree downloaded from TimeTree.org doesn't assign absolute ages to each node but rather relative ages, the length of each branch needs to be added to a total age variable. 

   - During the iteration process, it's checked to see whether the current position in the tree is a leaf or a node. If it's a node, we continue searching through the tree. As soon as a leaf is reached, the age of that leaf is added to the total age and we stop searching the tree. This is because we've completely gone down one branch of the subtree and have obtained the age. 

   - We then use the ete3 subtree.traverse("postorder") to find the age of the common ancestor in the tree. We divide this in half and add it to the total. This is the final age we upload to MySQL


algorithm [2]: Used when only one species is present

   - The algorithm for this case is much simpler than algorithm [1]. The species is located within the overall tree, the distance (age) is determined using the simple ete3 function node.dist and the age is divided in half. This is the age that is assigned to the Pfam
