'''
The purpose of this function is to check a coding sequence to make sure that it:

    1) Starts with a start codon
    2) Doesn't contain any in-frame stop codons
    3) Is a multiple of 3 nucleotides in length.

The function takes a coding sequence as input and returns either:

    1) True if the coding sequence passes all filters
    or 
    2) False if any of the conditions are not met
