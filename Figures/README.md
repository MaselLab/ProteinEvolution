## PlotFullPfamDataSet_BoxAndWhiskers.py

Author : Sara Willis
Date   : February 1, 2019

#### TO RUN: 
```
python3 <filename.py> --Metric
```
Choose metrics option from below or type --options
The purpose of this script is to plot the means and standard errors of various protein domain metrics vs. the age of that domain.
There are a variety of metrics that can be plotted. The metric is specified by the user as a command-line argument. They are the following:
   1) --ISD : The mean ISD predicted by IUPred 2
   2) --DensityOfAPRs : The number of aggregation-prone regions divided by the length of the protein calculated using the output of TANGO
   3) --DensityOfAAsInAPRs : The number of amino acids located in aggregation-prone regions divided by the length of the protein, calculated using the output of TANGO
   4) --Clustering_Trunc : The normalized index of dispersion using FILVM as the most hydrophobic amino acids and using one window
   5) --Clustering_AllFrames: The normalized index of dispersion using FILVM as the most hydrophobic amino acids, calculated using all possible windows
   6) --Length : The length of the amino acid sequence
The output filename is rplot.pdf

## PlotFullProteinDataSet_BoxAndWhiskers.py

#### TO RUN: 
```
python3 <filename.py> --Metric
```

Choose metrics option from below or type --options
The purpose of this script is to generate a box-and-whiskers plot of various protein metrics vs. the age of that protein. The heading of the plot will be the p-value associated with the linear model Metric~Age and the linear as well as loess regression lines are plotted as an overlay.

## PlotFullProteinDataSet_MeansAndStandardErrors.py

#### TO RUN: 
```
python3 <filename.py> --Metric
```
Choose metrics option from the list below or type --options to get a list in your terminal window


The purpose of this script is to plot the means and standard errors of various protein metrics vs. the age of that protein. The metrics determined for each protein are for that entire protein and not for any specific domains contained within it. Since there are a variety of metrics associated with proteins, this script has been designed so that the user can simply select which metric they wish to plot from the command line and the script will pull the relevant values. 

The metrics that can be selected from are the following 

   1) --ISD : Mean ISD predicted by IUPred 2
   2) --DensityOfAPRs : The number of aggregation-prone regions divided by the length of the protein calculated using the output of TANGO
   3) --DensityOfAAsInAPRs : The number of amino acids located in aggregation-prone regions divided by the length of the protein, calculated using the output of TANGO
   4) --Clustering_Trunc : The normalized index of dispersion using FILVM as the most hydrophobic amino acids and using one window
   5) --Clustering_AllFrames: The normalized index of dispersion using FILVM as the most hydrophobic amino acids, calculated using all possible windows
   6) --Length : The length of the amino acid sequence
   

## PlotPfamDataSet_FourSpecies_BoxAndWhiskers.py

#### TO RUN: 
```
python3 <filename.py> --Metric
```

Choose metrics option from below or type --options

The purpose of this script is to plot the means and standard errors of various protein domain metrics vs. the age of that domain. This script is intended to plot four species in a single figure in a 2x2 grid. The default species are Mus Musculus, Drosophila Melanogaster, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, and Arabidopsis Thaliana. The species are specified by the user in the **User Data** section of the script as a list. This can be modified so the user can plot whichever species they want. To select from a list of species, see SpeciesList in the MySQL data table PFAMphylostratigraphy.

There are a variety of metrics that can be plotted. The metric is specified by the user as a command-line argument. They are the following:
   1) --ISD : The mean ISD predicted by IUPred 2
   2) --DensityOfAPRs : The number of aggregation-prone regions divided by the length of the protein calculated using the output of TANGO
   3) --DensityOfAAsInAPRs : The number of amino acids located in aggregation-prone regions divided by the length of the protein, calculated using the output of TANGO
   4) --Clustering_Trunc : The normalized index of dispersion using FILVM as the most hydrophobic amino acids and using one window
   5) --Clustering_AllFrames: The normalized index of dispersion using FILVM as the most hydrophobic amino acids, calculated using all possible windows
   6) --Length : The length of the amino acid sequence



## SpeciesSpecific_PlotAverageMetricVsAge_PfamOnly.py

#### TO RUN:
```
python3 <filename.py> --Metric [--y_min=VALUE --y_max=VALUE]
```
The purpose of this script is to generate scatterplots of the means and standard errors of a user-specified metric vs. Age for pfam domains across individual species. 

The user should specify the metric that should be plotted in the command line using the format specified under TO RUN. The options are the following:

   1) --ISD : The mean ISD predicted by IUPred 2
   2) --DensityOfAPRs : The number of aggregation-prone regions divided by the length of the protein calculated using the output of TANGO
   3) --DensityOfAAsInAPRs : The number of amino acids located in aggregation-prone regions divided by the length of the protein, calculated using the output of TANGO
   4) --Clustering_Trunc : The normalized index of dispersion using FILVM as the most hydrophobic amino acids and using one window
   5) --Clustering_AllFrames: The normalized index of dispersion using FILVM as the most hydrophobic amino acids, calculated using all possible windows
   6) --Length : The length of the domain

The user also has the option to make the various plots have uniform axes by specifying a y_min and y_max value for each figure. These are optional arguments. If none are specified, matplotlib uses the default settings.
